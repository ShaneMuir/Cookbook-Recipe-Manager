##### Database data
I credit the site listed below as this is where I pulled my recipe json data from which then I manipulated and edited so that it was fit for my project.
As this project is for education purposes only and will not be going publicly live under a registered domain, and that I have edited and adapted the data that 
just crediting the site withing my documentation would suffice from having to put a logo onto my site.
###### Recipes taken from this site :- [Edam](https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-docs-recipe-api)


###### Light box used

### Things that could be improve if had more time
Filters on index page could be made more dynamic so that if new diet labels or health labels that are not on the
list could be populated too in the backend.

Reset password could be implemented for incase a user forgets their password.
